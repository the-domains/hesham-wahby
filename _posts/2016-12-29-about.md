Hi, I'm Hesham! I am an engineer, entrepreneur and venture capitalist. But this website is not about that. Actually, it could be about that too, but also about all the other things that arouse my curiosity and sentiment, or distract me for hours.

Things like design, graphics, games, media, science, culture, computing, space; the list goes on. The website is a mix of content I've created myself, photos and stories that I might care to share from my personal life, as well as links to things I've curated from the Internet.

I hope you find something here of interest!
