# The Games Replay

This is my quest to chronicle the history of computer games. Over the next few years, or as long as I still have the interest and patience, I will collect, install, run, play and review every (significantly publicized) game ever made, in chronological order. I will consider all platforms, including computers, consoles and arcades.

Why, you may ask? Well I guess I'm just kind of a geek in that way. A long time ago, I used play games on the Amiga, and have a reasonably sized collection of games from that platform. Then, when I started university, and started using different other computer platforms, I've gotten busy and distracted by other things. But recently, I've started reviving my old games, and building an archive of a more modern computer system, and started playing them again. In doing so, I've realized how much I've been missing out on newer interesting games, as well as old games which I never got to play in the old days when access was much harder without the Internet. So I decided to go back and start from the beginning, and work my way to the present day.

Impossibly ambitious? Maybe. Will I miss some games? Of course. Fun? You bet! Too much work? Yeah, but who cares, it's worth it. And I will certainly learn something interesting along the way, and will share the whole experience with you through a series of blog posts here. It will also be cool little side project (as if I don't have enough already) to try out The Grid platform for building my website.

As a side effect, I am also developing an archiving system for games that will allow them to be played easily in a cross-platform environment. Games have become a form of art and cultural medium, and believe in preserving them, and finding a proper way for normal people to collect and appreciate them, without jumping through all the technical hoops of platform incompatibility. I know there are already a number of other people or groups attempting something similar out there, but I don't feel that any are adequate or hitting the mark in the way I have in mind. I will be sharing more details about this effort as it develops and as I go along, assuming I can get anywhere with it.

So let the games begin! We start tomorrow.
